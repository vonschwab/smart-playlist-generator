## Playlist Modes

**Updated in v3.3:** Independent genre and sonic mode controls for fine-grained playlist tuning.

### Genre Modes
Control how strictly playlists match genre tags:
- `strict` - Ultra-tight genre matching (single-genre deep dives)
- `narrow` - Stay close to seed genre (cohesive exploration)
- `dynamic` - Balanced exploration (default)
- `discover` - Genre-adjacent exploration (cross-genre discovery)
- `off` - Ignore genre tags completely (pure sonic matching)

### Sonic Modes
Control how strictly playlists match audio features:
- `strict` - Laser-focused sound (ultra-tight sonic matching)
- `narrow` - Consistent texture (cohesive sound)
- `dynamic` - Balanced sonic flow (default)
- `discover` - Sonic variety (varied textures)
- `off` - Ignore sonic features (pure genre matching)

### Examples

```bash
# Ultra-cohesive (strict genre + strict sonic)
python main_app.py --artist "Radiohead" --genre-mode strict --sonic-mode strict

# Same genre, varied sound
python main_app.py --artist "Bill Evans" --genre-mode narrow --sonic-mode discover

# Pure sonic similarity (ignore genres)
python main_app.py --genre "ambient" --genre-mode off --sonic-mode dynamic

# Discovery mode (explore connections)
python main_app.py --genre "jazz" --genre-mode discover --sonic-mode discover
```

See [docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md#mode-based-configuration-simplified-tuning) for full mode documentation.

## DJ Bridge Mode (Multi-Seed Playlists)

**New in v3.3:** Advanced multi-seed playlist generation with genre-aware routing.

### What is DJ Bridge Mode?

DJ Bridge mode creates smooth transitions between **multiple seed tracks** (called "piers") by building genre-aware bridges. Unlike single-seed playlists, DJ mode explicitly controls genre evolution across the playlist.

**Example:**
```bash
python main_app.py --seeds "Slowdive,Beach House,Deerhunter,Helvetia" --tracks 30
```

**Result:** 30-track playlist with 3 segments bridging the seeds:
- Segment 1: Slowdive → Beach House (shoegaze → ethereal dream pop)
- Segment 2: Beach House → Deerhunter (ethereal → indie/noise pop)
- Segment 3: Deerhunter → Helvetia (indie → lo-fi/slowcore)

### Phase 2: Genre Bridging Enhancements (2026-01-09)

**Problem Solved:** Hub genre collapse where waypoints would default to generic genres (e.g., "indie rock") instead of respecting nuanced signatures (e.g., "shoegaze", "dreampop").

**Three-pronged solution:**

1. **Vector Mode** - Direct multi-genre interpolation
   - Preserves full genre signatures throughout bridge
   - No more single-label collapse

2. **IDF Weighting** - Emphasize rare genres
   - Rare genres (shoegaze, slowcore): high weight (0.8-1.0)
   - Common genres (indie rock): low weight (0.1-0.3)

3. **Coverage Bonus** - Reward anchor signature matching
   - Tracks top-8 genres from each seed
   - Rewards candidates matching these signatures
   - Schedule decay for smooth transitions

**Results:**
- ✅ **+400% genre diversity** in targets (4-5 genres/step vs 1 label)
- ✅ **Rare genres preserved** (shoegaze, dreampop, slowcore)
- ✅ **Smoother bridges** with better genre alignment
- ✅ **Comprehensive diagnostics** showing decision-making

### Phase 3: Saturation & Provenance Fixes (2026-01-09)

**Problem Solved:** Waypoint and coverage scoring would plateau at caps, reducing ranking influence. Genre pool contribution was zero due to a critical bug.

**Four-pronged solution:**

1. **Centered Waypoint Delta** - Subtract step-wise baseline to allow negative deltas
   - Prevents constant positive offset
   - Reduces ties at cap
   - Adapts per-step to candidate distribution

2. **Tanh Squashing** - Smooth squashing to prevent hard plateaus
   - Preserves score differences for all candidates
   - No hard plateaus at cap
   - Alpha tunable for desired steepness

3. **Coverage Improvements** - Raw presence source + weighted mode
   - Reduces false positives from smoothing spillover
   - Creates continuous gradient instead of discrete steps
   - Fewer ties at coverage extremes

4. **Genre Pool Fix (CRITICAL)** - Fixed genre_vocab gate blocking vector mode
   - Genre pool was always empty even with k_genre=80
   - Vector mode doesn't need genre_vocab
   - Now genre candidates contribute properly

**Results:**
- ✅ **-84% waypoint saturation** (mean_delta: 0.095 → 0.015)
- ✅ **+100% ranking influence** (winner_changed: 1/3 → 2/3)
- ✅ **-60% coverage saturation** (mean_bonus: 0.104 → 0.042)
- ✅ **Genre pool populated** (was 0, now 240+ candidates/segment)

**Configuration (Recommended Production Settings):**
```yaml
pier_bridge:
  dj_bridging:
    enabled: true
    route_shape: ladder
    # Phase 2: Vector mode + IDF + Coverage
    dj_ladder_target_mode: vector

### When to Use DJ Bridge Mode

✅ **Use when:**
- You have 2+ seed tracks from different artists/genres
- You want controlled genre evolution
- You want to bridge stylistically distant artists smoothly

❌ **Don't use when:**
- Single seed track (use regular modes)
- All seeds from same artist (use artist style clustering)

## DS Run Audits (3.3)
- Per-run markdown audits: add `--audit-run` (optional `--audit-run-dir docs/run_audits`) to record pool sizes, segment gating, scoring, and post-order validation.
- Infeasible segment handling (optional): add `--pb-backoff` to retry segments with a deterministic `bridge_floor` backoff (attempts are recorded in the audit).
- Recency invariant: Last.fm/local recency exclusions are applied **pre-order only**; verify logs include exactly one `stage=candidate_pool | Last.fm recency exclusions: ...` line and one `stage=post_order_validation | ...` line.

## GUI Highlights (3.3)
- **Genre Mode** - Generate playlists by genre with smart autocomplete showing both exact matches and similar genres (similarity ≥ 0.7)
- **Seed List Mode** - Add multiple explicit seed tracks (per-row autocomplete)
- **Accent-insensitive Autocomplete** - Type "Joao" and see "João Gilberto" for both artist and genre fields
- **Atomized Genre Data** - All 746 genres properly normalized and split (no compound strings like "indie rock, alternative")
- **Track Table Export** - Export buttons fixed; context menu still available
- **Progress/Log Panels** - Wired to worker with request correlation
- **Run All Button** - One-click pipeline execution (Scan → Genres → Sonic → Artifacts)

## MBID Enrichment (3.2)
- `scripts/fetch_mbids_musicbrainz.py` queries MusicBrainz by artist/title (with collab/feature handling) and writes MBIDs to `tracks.musicbrainz_id` (no file writes). Uses skip markers (`__NO_MATCH__`, `__ERROR__`); reprocess with `--force-no-match`/`--force-error` or all with `--force-all`.
- `scripts/analyze_library.py` supports a `mbid` stage: `--stages scan,mbid,genres,...` to enrich during full runs.
- Last.FM matching now prefers MBIDs for instant, exact mapping.

### Diagnostics & Support
- GUI logs: `%APPDATA%\PlaylistGenerator\logs\playlist_gui.log` (rotates 5 x 2MB). Secret-aware redaction is applied to all UI/worker lines.
- Copy/Save Debug Report: Help -> Copy Debug Report or Save Debug Report. Copies/saves a redacted bundle (environment, config path, preset/mode, last job, readiness checks, tail of GUI/worker logs).
- Readiness banner: non-modal warning at the top of the window when prerequisites are missing (config/DB/artifacts/worker). Shows `Last checked: HH:MM` with CTAs to re-run checks, open Jobs, queue Scan/Artifacts, copy debug report, retry queue, or dismiss.
- Layout persistence: window/dock layout, last config path, mode, artist query, preset, and track filter are restored via QSettings. Reset via View -> Reset UI Layout.
- Doctor command: `{"cmd":"doctor","request_id":"<uuid>","base_config_path":"...","overrides":{}}` returns quick check results.
- Jobs pane: Queue/History filter; Clear Pending empties the queue immediately (pending count drops to zero).
