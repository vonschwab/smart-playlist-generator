# Diagnostics

This directory is for active diagnostic and audit documentation during development.

## Purpose

Place diagnostic reports, A/B test results, and audits here while actively working on features or investigations.

## Archiving

When a development cycle is complete, move diagnostics to `docs/archive/diagnostics_YYYY-MM/` to keep this directory clean.

## Current Diagnostics

(Empty - ready for next development cycle)
